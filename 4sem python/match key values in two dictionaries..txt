Write a Python program to match key values in two dictionaries.

s=  {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 2}
s1 ={'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}

#Expected output: key1: 1 is present in both x and y 

for i in s: 
  if i in s1: 
     if s[i] == s1[i] : 
       print (f"{i} :{s[i]} is present in both set")
