Write a Python program to display occurrence of the elements in the tuple, which appears more than 2 times.

t = [1,1,2,3,4,5,2,2,2,6,7,8,1,2,1] 

s = []
for i in range(0,len(t)):
  k=0
  for j in range(0, len(t)):
    if t[i] == t[j] and i!=j: 
       k = k +1
  if k > 2:
    s.append(t[i])
    
  
print (set(s))
