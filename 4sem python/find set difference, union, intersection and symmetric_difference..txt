Write a Python program to find set difference, union, intersection and symmetric_difference.

s1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
s2 = {1,3,5,7,9}

d3 = s1.difference(s2)
print ("Difference is:",d3)

d4 = s1.union(s2)
print ("Union is:",d4)

d5 = s1.intersection(s2)
print ("intersection is:",d5)

d6 = s1.symmetric_difference (s2)
print ("Symmetric difference is:",d6)
